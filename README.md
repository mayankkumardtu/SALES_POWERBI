Right now, total profit is at ₹36,963 on ₹437k+ in revenue, with an average profit of ₹6.58 per item.
States doing the heavy lifting in overall profit:
Madhya Pradesh → ₹7,382
Maharashtra → ₹6,963
Uttar Pradesh → ₹3,358
These are clearly winning on volume and consistency.
But here’s the part that surprised me 👀
Profit per unit sold (how much we actually keep per product):
Tamil Nadu → ₹28.6 per item
Kerala → ₹15.5
Himachal Pradesh → ₹14.7
Not the biggest in order count, but extremely efficient. Makes you wonder what’s working better in these regions.
Category-wise takeaways:
Clothing → most profit overall (₹13,325), driven by high order volume
Electronics → biggest revenue share (₹166k)
Furniture → highest profit per order (~₹43)
Products that are quietly printing money:
Printers → ₹8,606
Bookcases → ₹6,516
Sarees → ₹4,057
Feels like we’re winning on volume with clothing, value with electronics, and margins with furniture — while some regions are outperforming simply by selling smarter, not more.
